	abstract = {Newcastle disease ({ND}) is a serious disease of poultry that causes significant economic losses. Despite rampant {ND} outbreaks that occur annually in Kenya, the information about the {NDV} circulating in Kenya is still scarce. We report the first countrywide study of {NDV} in Kenya. Our study is aimed at evaluating the genetic characteristics of Newcastle disease viruses obtained from backyard poultry in farms and live bird markets in different regions of Kenya. We sequenced and analyzed fusion (F) protein gene, including the cleavage site, of the obtained viruses. We aligned and compared study sequences with representative {NDV} of different genotypes from {GenBank}. The fusion protein cleavage site of all the study sequences had the motif 112RRQKRFV118 indicating their velogenic nature. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the {NDV} from various sites in Kenya was highly similar genetically and that it clustered together with {NDV} of genotype V. The study samples were 96\&\#x0025; similar to previous Ugandan and Kenyan viruses grouped in subgenotype Vd This study points to possible circulation of {NDV} of similar genetic characteristics between backyard poultry farms and live bird markets in Kenya. The study also suggests the possible spread of velogenic {NDV} between Kenya and Uganda possibly through cross-border live bird trade. Our study provides baseline information on the genetic characteristics of {NDV} circulating in the Kenyan poultry population. This highlights the need for the {ND} control programmes to place more stringent measures on cross-border trade of live bird markets and poultry products to prevent the introduction of new strains of {NDV} that would otherwise be more difficult to control.},

	abstract = {The sudden emergence of severe respiratory disease, caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2), has recently become a public health emergency. Genome sequence analysis of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 revealed its close resemblance to the earlier reported {SARS}-{CoV} and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}). However, initial testing of the drugs used against {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} has been ineffective in controlling {SARS}-{CoV}-2. The present study highlights the genomic, proteomic, pathogenesis, and therapeutic strategies in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. We have carried out sequence analysis of potential drug target proteins in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and, compared them with {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS} viruses. Analysis of mutations in the coding and non-coding regions, genetic diversity, and pathogenicity of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 has also been done. A detailed structural analysis of drug target proteins has been performed to gain insights into the mechanism of pathogenesis, structure-function relationships, and the development of structure-guided therapeutic approaches. The cytokine profiling and inflammatory signalling are different in the case of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. We also highlighted possible therapies and their mechanism of action followed by clinical manifestation. Our analysis suggests a minimal variation in the genome sequence of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, may be responsible for a drastic change in the structures of target proteins, which makes available drugs ineffective.},

The intended audience is statisticians, biostatisticians, epidemiologists and quantitatively- oriented geneticists and health scientists wanting to learn about statistical methods for genetic analysis, whether to better analyze genetic data, or to pursue research in methodology.A background in intermediate level statistical methods is required.The authors include fewmathematical derivations, and the exercises provide problems for students with a broad range of skill levels.No background in genetics is assumed.},
