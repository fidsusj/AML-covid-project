  abstract = {Understanding the spread and evolution of pathogens is important for effective public health measures and surveillance. Nextstrain consists of a database of viral genomes, a bioinformatics pipeline for phylodynamics analysis, and an interactive visualization platform. Together these present a real-time view into the evolution and spread of a range of viral pathogens of high public health importance. The visualization integrates sequence data with other data types such as geographic information, serology, or host species. Nextstrain compiles our current understanding into a single accessible location, open to health professionals, epidemiologists, virologists and the public alike.All code (predominantly JavaScript and Python) is freely available from github.com/nextstrain and the web-application is available at nextstrain.org.}

  abstract = {This book covers the statistical models and methods that are used to understand human genetics, following the historical and recent developments of human genetics. Starting with Mendels first experiments to genome-wide association studies, the book describes how genetic information can be incorporated into statistical models to discover disease genes.All commonly used approaches in statistical genetics (e.g. aggregation analysis, segregation, linkage analysis, etc), are used, but the focus of the book is modern approaches to association analysis.Numerous examples illustrate key points throughout the text, both of Mendelian and complex genetic disorders. The intended audience is statisticians, biostatisticians, epidemiologists and quantitatively- oriented geneticists and health scientists wanting to learn about statistical methods for genetic analysis, whether to better analyze genetic data, or to pursue research in methodology.A background in intermediate level statistical methods is required.The authors include fewmathematical derivations, and the exercises provide problems for students with a broad range of skill levels.No background in genetics is assumed.},

  abstract = {The sudden emergence of severe respiratory disease, caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has recently become a public health emergency. Genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed its close resemblance to the earlier reported SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, initial testing of the drugs used against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has been ineffective in controlling SARS-CoV-2. The present study highlights the genomic, proteomic, pathogenesis, and therapeutic strategies in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have carried out sequence analysis of potential drug target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 and, compared them with SARS-CoV and MERS viruses. Analysis of mutations in the coding and non-coding regions, genetic diversity, and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 has also been done. A detailed structural analysis of drug target proteins has been performed to gain insights into the mechanism of pathogenesis, structure-function relationships, and the development of structure-guided therapeutic approaches. The cytokine profiling and inflammatory signalling are different in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also highlighted possible therapies and their mechanism of action followed by clinical manifestation. Our analysis suggests a minimal variation in the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, may be responsible for a drastic change in the structures of target proteins, which makes available drugs ineffective.},

  abstract = {Newcastle disease (ND) is a serious disease of poultry that causes significant economic losses. Despite rampant ND outbreaks that occur annually in Kenya, the information about the NDV circulating in Kenya is still scarce. We report the first countrywide study of NDV in Kenya. Our study is aimed at evaluating the genetic characteristics of Newcastle disease viruses obtained from backyard poultry in farms and live bird markets in different regions of Kenya. We sequenced and analyzed fusion (F) protein gene, including the cleavage site, of the obtained viruses. We aligned and compared study sequences with representative NDV of different genotypes from GenBank. The fusion protein cleavage site of all the study sequences had the motif 112RRQKRFV118 indicating their velogenic nature. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the NDV from various sites in Kenya was highly similar genetically and that it clustered together with NDV of genotype V. The study samples were 96\&\#x0025; similar to previous Ugandan and Kenyan viruses grouped in subgenotype Vd This study points to possible circulation of NDV of similar genetic characteristics between backyard poultry farms and live bird markets in Kenya. The study also suggests the possible spread of velogenic NDV between Kenya and Uganda possibly through cross-border live bird trade. Our study provides baseline information on the genetic characteristics of NDV circulating in the Kenyan poultry population. This highlights the need for the ND control programmes to place more stringent measures on cross-border trade of live bird markets and poultry products to prevent the introduction of new strains of NDV that would otherwise be more difficult to control.}
